		<h3><abbr title="Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group">WHATWG</abbr></h3>
		<p>
		The <strong>Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group</strong> (<strong><abbr title="Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group">WHATWG</abbr></strong>) is the working-group responsible for setting the standard for many of the core technologies on the Web and Internet
		—
		the most famous probably being HTML5.
		</p>

		—
		further developing it as a semantically-rich cross-platform application development platform.
		</p>

		<h3>Show In A Box</h3>
		<p>
		The word “vlog” appears in most modern English dictionaries as both a <em>noun</em> and <em>verb</em>.
		</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>
		vlog (noun):
		A weblog using video as its primary presentation format.
		</p>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
		<p>
		vlog (verb):
		To post a video to a video weblog.
		</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
		The origin of this word (“vlog”) goes back to an online community — the “videblogging” mailing list.
		The noun “videoblog” was shortened to “vlog”.
		</p>
		<p>
		(Historical context note — mailing lists were one of the popular forms of social-media during this era.
		What most people think of as <em>social media</em> today (such as Twitter, Instagram, and others) were nascent technologies back then.
		Back then it was common for online communities to form on mailing lists during this era.)
		</p>
		<p>
		This <em>video blogging</em> online community existed during a era of the Web &amp; Internet where the Web was still largely text and image based.
		Where video was still mostly not practical.
		But where a group of people, whose nexus was on the videoblogging mailing list, wanted to change things, and bring video to the Web and the Internet.
		</p>
		<p>
		Charles was part of this community — the “videblogging” community.
		</p>
		<p>
		A small number of people from this “videblogging” community (including Charles) created the first open-source social-media software for video — it was called “Show In A Box” (<abbr title="Show In A Box">SIAB</abbr>).
		</p>
		<p>
		This was an important technology for the era, as nothing like it existed at the time.

		<h3>Mono Handbook</h3>
		<p>
		.NET is the technology platform
		that (via Unity) famous video games such as <em>Pokémon Go</em>, <em>Among Us</em>, and <em>Cuphead</em> were created with,
		that is a staple of fortune 500 enterprises software and product development, and
		that the C# &amp; F# programming languages are built on.
		</p>
		<p>
		Mono was the first open-source implementation of .NET.
		(At the time, Microsoft's implementation of .NET was still closed-source.)
		</p>
		<p>
		The Mono Handbook is a guide to the Mono runtime, related tools, libraries, and .NET itself, developed by the Mono team.
		</p>
		<p>
		In 2003, while Charles was part of the Mono team, he co-authored "The Mono Handbook".
		</p>
		<p>
		(He wrote the chapters on GTK#, GNOME# and Rsvg#.)

		<h3>Netscape Open Directory</h3>
		<p>
		Netscape was at one time one of the most famous companies on the Web — being the company behind the most popular web-browser at the time.
		Netscape is the company probably most responsible for making the Web and the Internet ubiquitous.
		Their flagship product, the Netscape web-browser, was for a long time the doorway to the Web for most people in the world.
		</p>
		<p>
		In 1998, Netscape created the <em>Netscape Open Directory</em> via an acquisition of NewHoo (which was previously named ‘Gnuhoo’).
		</p>
		<p>
		The <em>Netscape Open Directory</em>, later rebranded to the <em>Open Directory Project</em> and <em><abbr title="directory mozilla">dmoz</abbr></em>, was a multilingual open-content directory for the Web.
		</p>
		<p>
		This was during an era of the Web when the problem of <em>searching</em> the Web hadn't been solved yet — during the surfing-the-web era.
		When human curated directories of references to web-sites and web-pages were still important.
		</p>
		<p>
		From 1997 to 2000, Charles was an editor on Netscape's (and later AOL Time Warner's) Open Directory Project (a.k.a. "dmoz").
		Charles helped to create the Netscape Open Directory,
		</p>
		<p>
		His work was used by corporations such as: Google, Alexa, AOL, Lycos, Netscape, and many many others.
		(Which were famous and well-known tech companies of that era.)
